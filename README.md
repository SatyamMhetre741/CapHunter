This is a fun little project I made to brush up my js skills and to learn usign RESTful APIs <br>
In the js code, the countries are stored in an array and the<br>
capitals are fetched through 
https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/{name} - gives any countries full data <br> from which we are intrest in the capital key
